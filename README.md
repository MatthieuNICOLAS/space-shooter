Space Shooter
==============

This project's goal is just to follow [this tutorial](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter) to learn [Unity](http://unity3d.com). I also want to learn how to setup my Unity project to use **Git** source control.

Setting up a Unity project for Git
---------------

According to [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18225126/how-to-use-git-for-unity3d-source-control) and [this article](http://blog.hfarazm.com/git-for-unity-create-projects/), the main steps to setup your project to use **Git** are the following:

* In ```Edit → Project Settings → Editor```
  * Set ```Version Control Mode``` to ```Visible Meta Files```
  * Set ```Asset Serialization Mode``` to ```Force Text```
* Save the scene and project


.gitignore
---------------

The *.gitignore* file I'm using comes from [this repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
